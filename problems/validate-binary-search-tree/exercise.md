# 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, *determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)*.

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

- The left **subtree**** of a node contains only nodes with keys **strictly less than** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **strictly greater than** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

** A **subtree** of `treeName` is a tree consisting of a node in `treeName` and all of its descendants.

### Example 1:

![image](tree1.jpg)

```text
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true
```

### Example 2:

![image](tree2.jpg)

```text
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
``` 

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10<sup>4</sup>].
- -2<sup>31</sup> <= Node.val <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
